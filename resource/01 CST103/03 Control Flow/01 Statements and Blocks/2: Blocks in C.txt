Unit 2: Blocks in C
Braces `{` and `}` are used to group declarations and statements together into a compound statement, or block, so that they are syntactically equivalent to a single statement. The braces that surround the statements of a function are one obvious example; braces around multiple statements after an `if`, `else`, `while`, or `for` are another.
