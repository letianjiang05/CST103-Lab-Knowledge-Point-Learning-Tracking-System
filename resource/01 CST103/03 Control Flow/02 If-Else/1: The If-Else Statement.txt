Unit 1: The If-Else Statement
The if-else statement is used to express decisions. Formally the syntax is:
```c
if (expression)
    statement1
else
    statement2
```
The else part is optional. The expression is evaluated; if it is true (that is, if the expression has a non-zero value), statement1 is executed. If it is false (expression is zero) and if there is an else part, statement2 is executed instead.
