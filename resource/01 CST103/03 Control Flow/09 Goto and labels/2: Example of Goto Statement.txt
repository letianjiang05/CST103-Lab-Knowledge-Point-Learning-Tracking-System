Unit 2: Example of Goto Statement
Here is an example of using goto to handle errors in a nested loop structure:
```c
for ( ... )
    for ( ... ) {
        ...
        if (disaster)
            goto error;
    }
    ...
error:
    /* clean up the mess */
```
This organization is handy if the error-handling code is non-trivial, and if errors can occur in several places.
