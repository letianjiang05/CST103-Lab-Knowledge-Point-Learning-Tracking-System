Unit 4: Example of Goto Statement in Array Search
Consider the problem of determining whether two arrays `a` and `b` have an element in common. One possibility is:
```c
for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    for (j = 0; j < m; j++)
        if (a[i] == b[j])
            goto found;
/* didn't find any common element */
...
found:
/* got one: a[i] == b[j] */
...
```
Code involving a goto can always be written without one, though perhaps at the price of some repeated tests or an extra variable. For example, the array search becomes:
```c
found = 0;
for (i = 0; i < n && !found; i++)
    for (j = 0; j < m && !found; j++)
        if (a[i] == b[j])
            found = 1;
if (found)
    /* got one: a[i-1] == b[j-1] */
    ...
else
    /* didn't find any common element */
    ...
```
