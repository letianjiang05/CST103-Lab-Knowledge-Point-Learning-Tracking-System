Unit 1: The Switch Statement
The switch statement is a multi-way decision that tests whether an expression matches one of a number of constant integer values, and branches accordingly. Each case is labeled by one or more integer-valued constants or constant expressions. If a case matches the expression value, execution starts at that case. All case expressions must be different. The case labeled default is executed if none of the other cases are satisfied. A default is optional; if it isn't there and if none of the cases match, no action at all takes place. Cases and the default clause can occur in any order.
