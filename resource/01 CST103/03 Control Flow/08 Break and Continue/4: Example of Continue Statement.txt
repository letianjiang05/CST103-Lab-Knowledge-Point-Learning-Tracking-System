Unit 4: Example of Continue Statement
This fragment processes only the non-negative elements in the array `a`; negative values are skipped.
```c
for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
    if (a[i] < 0) /* skip negative elements */
        continue;
    ... /* do positive elements */
```
The continue statement is often used when the part of the loop that follows is complicated, so that reversing a test and indenting another level would nest the program too deeply.
