Unit 2: Usage and Initialization of Structures
A struct declaration defines a type, allowing the creation of variables of that type. An example struct point pt; defines a variable pt of type struct point. Initialization of structures can be done through initializers for its members, allowing the creation of instances with predefined values.

Structures can also be initialized through assignment or by utilizing functions returning structures of the correct type. Accessing members within a structure is achieved using the dot . operator, connecting the structure name and the member name.
