Unit 2: Table Structure and Hashing
The table is structured using a hash-search algorithm. A hash function generates an index based on the character values of the string. This index points to an array of pointers. Each array element points to a linked list of blocks describing names sharing the same hash value.

The block structure comprises pointers to the name, replacement text, and the next block in the list. The hashing function ensures a non-negative hash value and indexes into hashtab.
