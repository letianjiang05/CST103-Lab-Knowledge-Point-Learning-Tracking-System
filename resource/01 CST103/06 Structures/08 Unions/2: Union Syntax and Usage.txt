Unit 2: Union Syntax and Usage
A union declaration is similar to a structure. For example:

c
Copy code
union u_tag {
    int ival;
    float fval;
    char *sval;
} u;
Here, u can store the largest among the types specified. It's the programmer's responsibility to track which type is currently stored in the union, as retrieving a different type than the one stored yields implementation-dependent results.
