Unit 4: Typedef Benefits
Portability: Typedefs assist in abstracting machine-dependent types, allowing a program to be more portable. Altering typedefs accommodates changes in data types across different machines without modifying the code significantly.
Documentation and Readability: Typedefs enhance code clarity and documentation. For instance, using Treeptr provides a more understandable representation compared to explicitly declaring a pointer to a complex structure.

typedef does not create new types but provides aliases for existing ones.
It resembles #define but is interpreted by the compiler and can handle complex textual substitutions.
Its use can improve portability and code readability by abstracting machine-dependent types and offering more descriptive type names.
