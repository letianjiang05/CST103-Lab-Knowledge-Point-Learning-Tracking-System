Unit 2: Functions for Manipulating Points and Rectangles
The demonstration involves writing functions to handle points and rectangles using structures. The makepoint function initializes a point structure from x and y components. This function can initialize structures dynamically or provide structured arguments to other functions.

Functions like addpoint demonstrate arithmetic operations on points, taking structures as both arguments and return values. The function ptinrect checks if a point lies inside a rectangle, adhering to a specific convention for rectangle boundaries. Additionally, the canonrect function ensures a rectangle's coordinates are in a standardized form.
