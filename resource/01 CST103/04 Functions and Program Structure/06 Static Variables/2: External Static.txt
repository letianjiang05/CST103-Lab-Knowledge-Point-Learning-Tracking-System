Unit 2: External Static
The static declaration, applied to an external variable or function, limits the scope of that object to the rest of the source file being compiled. External static thus provides a way to hide names like `buf` and `bufp` in the `getch-ungetch` combination, which must be external so they can be shared, yet which should not be visible to users of `getch` and `ungetch`.
