Unit 1: File Inclusion in C Programming

1. **Syntax and Purpose**
   - `#include "filename"` or `#include <filename>` directives are used for file inclusion.
   - Replaces the directive line with the contents of the specified file during compilation.
   - Quoted vs. Brackets: Quoted filenames typically begin searching where the source file is located; `<filename>` uses an implementation-defined rule for file search.
  
2. **Nested Inclusions**
   - An included file can contain its own `#include` lines, allowing a hierarchical inclusion structure.

3. **Common Usage**
   - Commonly used at the start of a source file to include `#define` statements, extern declarations, and function prototypes from headers like `<stdio.h>` or user-defined headers.
   - Promotes modularity and reusability by organizing code into separate files and headers.

4. **Benefits and Considerations**
   - Preferred Practice: Ensures uniform definitions and variable declarations across multiple source files in a large program.
   - Bug Prevention: Helps eliminate bugs caused by inconsistent or mismatched definitions.
   - Recompilation: When an included file is modified, dependent files need recompilation to synchronize changes.

`#include` serves as a foundational mechanism for organizing code into reusable components, maintaining consistency across multiple files, and facilitating efficient code management in larger programs.
