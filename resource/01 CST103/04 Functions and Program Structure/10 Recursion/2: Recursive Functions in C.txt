Unit 2: Recursive Functions in C
Here is an example of a recursive function in C:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
/* printd: print n in decimal */
void printd(int n)
{
    if (n < 0) {
        putchar('-');
        n = -n;
    }
    if (n / 10)
        printd(n / 10);
    putchar(n % 10 + '0');
}
```
When a function calls itself recursively, each invocation gets a fresh set of all the automatic variables, independent of the previous set. This in printd(123) the first printd receives the argument n = 123. It passes 12 to a second printd, which in turn passes 1 to a third. The third-level printd prints 1, then returns to the second level. That printd prints 2, then returns to the first level. That one prints 3 and terminates.
