Unit 2: Variable Scope and Hiding
Variables declared in this way hide any identically named variables in outer blocks, and remain in existence until the matching right brace. An automatic variable declared and initialized in a block is initialized each time the block is entered. Automatic variables, including formal parameters, also hide external variables and functions of the same name.
