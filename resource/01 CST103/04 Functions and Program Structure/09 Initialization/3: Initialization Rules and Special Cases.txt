Unit 3: Initialization Rules and Special Cases
For external and static variables, the initializer must be a constant expression; the initialization is done once, conceptionally before the program begins execution. For automatic and register variables, the initializer is not restricted to being a constant: it may be any expression involving previously defined values, even function calls. Character arrays are a special case of initialization; a string may be used instead of the braces and commas notation. For example:
```c
char pattern = "ould";
```
is a shorthand for the longer but equivalent
```c
char pattern[] = { 'o', 'u', 'l', 'd', '\0' };
```
In this case, the array size is five (four characters plus the terminating '\0').
