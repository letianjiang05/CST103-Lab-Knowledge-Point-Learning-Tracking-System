Unit 2: Scalar Variables and Arrays
Scalar variables may be initialized when they are defined, by following the name with an equals sign and an expression. For example:
```c
int x = 1;
char squota = '\'';
long day = 1000L * 60L * 60L * 24L; /* milliseconds/day */
```
An array may be initialized by following its declaration with a list of initializers enclosed in braces and separated by commas. For example, to initialize an array days with the number of days in each month:
```c
int days[] = { 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31 }
```
When the size of the array is omitted, the compiler will compute the length by counting the initializers, of which there are 12 in this case.
