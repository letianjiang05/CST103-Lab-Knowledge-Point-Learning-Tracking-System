Unit 2: fgets and fputs Functions

The fgets function reads input lines from a file, appending a newline character, and stores the result in a character array. It returns the line read and terminates it with '\0', signaling EOF or error with a NULL return. Conversely, fputs writes a string (sans a newline) to a file and returns EOF on error.
