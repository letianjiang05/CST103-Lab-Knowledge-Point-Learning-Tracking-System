Unit 3: Utilizing 'exit' and 'ferror'

The 'exit' function terminates program execution and returns a status code, aiding in signalizing successful execution (usually 0) or abnormal scenarios (non-zero values). It also ensures any buffered output is flushed by implicitly calling 'fclose'. The 'ferror' function validates if an error occurred on a specific stream ('fp'), essential in handling output errors, albeit rare.

By integrating 'stderr' for error output and employing 'exit' to manage program termination and exit statuses, the revised 'cat' program demonstrates improved error handling. In real-world applications, monitoring and utilizing exit statuses is crucial for effective program behavior and error management.
