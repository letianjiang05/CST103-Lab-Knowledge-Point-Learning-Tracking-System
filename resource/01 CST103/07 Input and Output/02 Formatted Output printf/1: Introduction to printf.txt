Unit 1: Introduction to printf
The output function printf translates internal values to characters. We have used printf informally in previous chapters. The description here covers most typical uses but is not complete; for the full story, see Appendix B. printf converts, formats, and prints its arguments on the standard output under control of the format. It returns the number of characters printed.
