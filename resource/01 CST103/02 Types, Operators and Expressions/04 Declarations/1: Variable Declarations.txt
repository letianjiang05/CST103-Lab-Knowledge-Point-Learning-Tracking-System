Unit 1: Variable Declarations

In C, all variables must be declared before use. Declarations specify a type and contain a list of one or more variables of that type.

- Declaration example: 
  ```c
  int lower, upper, step;
  char c, line[1000];
  ```
- Variables can be distributed among declarations in any order.
- Declarations can also be written separately for clarity and ease of modification, with added comments for each variable.
