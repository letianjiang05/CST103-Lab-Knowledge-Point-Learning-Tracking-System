Unit 3: Constants and Initialization

The `const` qualifier can be applied to variables to specify that their values will not be changed.

- Example:
  ```c
  const double e = 2.71828182845905;
  const char msg[] = "warning: ";
  ```
- `const` can also be used with arrays to indicate that the elements will not be altered.
- Attempting to change a `const` results in implementation-defined behavior.
