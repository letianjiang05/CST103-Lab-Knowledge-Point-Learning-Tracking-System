Unit 2: Variable Initialization

Variables can be initialized during declaration by using an equals sign followed by an expression.

- Initialization example:
  ```c
  char esc = '\\';
  int i = 0;
  int limit = MAXLINE + 1;
  float eps = 1.0e-5;
  ```
- Initialization for non-automatic variables happens once, conceptually before the program starts executing.
- For explicitly initialized automatic variables, initialization occurs each time the function or block is entered.
