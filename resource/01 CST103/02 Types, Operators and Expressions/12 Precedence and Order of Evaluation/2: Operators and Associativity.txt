Unit 2: Operators and Associativity

The following table shows the associativity of operators:

() [] -> . - left to right ! ~ ++ -- + - * (type) sizeof - right to left

/ % - left to right
left to right << >> - left to right < <= > >= - left to right == != - left to right & - left to right ^ - left to right | - left to right && - left to right || - left to right ?: - right to left = += -= *= /= %= &= ^= |= <<= >>= - right to left , - left to right
Unary & +, -, and * have higher precedence than the binary forms.
