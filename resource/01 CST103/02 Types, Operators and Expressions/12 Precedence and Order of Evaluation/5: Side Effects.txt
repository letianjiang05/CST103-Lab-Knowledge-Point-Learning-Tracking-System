Unit 5: Side Effects

Function calls, nested assignment statements, and increment and decrement operators cause "side effects," where variables are changed as a by-product of expression evaluation. The order in which variables taking part in the expression are updated is left to the discretion of the compiler.

It is important to avoid writing code that depends on the order of evaluation, as it is not guaranteed to produce consistent results across different compilers and architectures.
