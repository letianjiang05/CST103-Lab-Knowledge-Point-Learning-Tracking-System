Unit 2: Logical Operators

The logical operators `&&` and `||` evaluate expressions from left to right and stop as soon as the truth or falsehood of the result is known.

- Commonly used for conditional evaluations and loops, where the evaluation order is crucial for efficiency.
- Example usage in a loop from a getline function:
  ```c
  for (i = 0; i < lim - 1 && (c = getchar()) != '\n' && c != EOF; ++i)
      s[i] = c;
  ```
  This ensures appropriate checks before reading new characters.
