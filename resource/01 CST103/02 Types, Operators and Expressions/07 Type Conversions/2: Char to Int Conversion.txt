Unit 2: Char to Int Conversion

In C, chars are small integers, permitting their use in arithmetic expressions.

- This allows transformations, like in the naive implementation of the `atoi` function that converts a string of digits into its numeric equivalent.
- Conversion from a character to an integer is facilitated by subtracting the ASCII values.
