Unit 1: Type Conversions Overview

When operators have operands of different types in C, they're converted to a common type based on specific rules.

- Automatic conversions usually involve converting a narrower operand to a wider one without losing information, like converting an integer to floating point in expressions.
- Sensible conversions occur; for instance, using a float as a subscript is not allowed.
