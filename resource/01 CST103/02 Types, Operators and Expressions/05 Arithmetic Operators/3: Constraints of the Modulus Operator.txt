Unit 3: Constraints of the Modulus Operator

- The `%` operator cannot be used with float or double operands.
- For negative operands, the direction of truncation for division (`/`) and the sign of the result for `%` are machine-dependent.
- Overflow or underflow actions are also machine-dependent.
