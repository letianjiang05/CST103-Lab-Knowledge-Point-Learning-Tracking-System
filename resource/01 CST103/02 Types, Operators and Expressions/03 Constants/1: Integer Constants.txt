Unit 1: Integer Constants

An integer constant like 1234 is considered an int. If the integer constant is too large to fit into an int, it will be considered a long. 

- A long constant is denoted with a terminal 'l' or 'L', like 123456789L.
- Unsigned constants are written with a terminal 'u' or 'U', while 'ul' or 'UL' indicates unsigned long.
