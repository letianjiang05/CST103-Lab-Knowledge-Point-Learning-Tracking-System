Unit 3: Octal and Hexadecimal Constants

An integer's value can be specified in octal or hexadecimal instead of decimal.

- A leading '0' denotes an octal constant; '0x' or '0X' denotes a hexadecimal constant.
- Octal and hexadecimal constants may also be followed by 'L' for long or 'U' for unsigned.
