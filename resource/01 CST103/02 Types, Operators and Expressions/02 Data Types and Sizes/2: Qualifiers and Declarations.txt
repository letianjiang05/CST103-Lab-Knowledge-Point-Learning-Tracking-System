Unit 2: Qualifiers and Declarations
Additional qualifiers can be applied to these basic types:

- short and long apply to integers. For instance:
  ```c
  short int sh;
  long int counter;
  ```
- The word 'int' can be omitted in such declarations, and typically it is.
- The intent is that 'short' and 'long' should provide different lengths of integers where practical.
