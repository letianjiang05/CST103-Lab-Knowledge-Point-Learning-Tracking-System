Unit 1: Increment and Decrement Operators Overview

In C, the `++` operator increments by 1, while the `--` operator decrements by 1. These operators can be used as prefix (++n) or postfix (n++).

- `++n` increments n before its value is used, while `n++` increments n after its value is used.
- For instance, `x = n++` sets x to the value of n before incrementing, while `x = ++n` increments n first, then assigns its value to x.
