Unit 1: Introduction to Functions

In C, a function is akin to a subroutine or function in Fortran or a procedure or function in Pascal. Functions offer a convenient way to encapsulate computation, enabling its use without concern for implementation details. With well-designed functions, understanding what a task accomplishes is sufficient, leaving the intricacies of its execution aside. C simplifies the utilization of functions, often leading to the definition and utilization of brief functions, even if they are called only once, for the sake of code clarity.
