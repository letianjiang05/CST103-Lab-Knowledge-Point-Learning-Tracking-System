Unit 1: Introduction to Complicated Declarations
C is sometimes castigated for the syntax of its declarations, particularly ones that involve pointers to functions. The syntax is an attempt to make the declaration and the use agree; it works well for simple cases, but it can be confusing for the harder ones, because declarations cannot be read left to right, and because parentheses are over-used. The difference between `int *f(); /* f: function returning pointer to int */` and `int (*pf)(); /* pf: pointer to function returning int */` illustrates the problem: * is a prefix operator and it has lower precedence than (), so parentheses are necessary to force the proper association.
