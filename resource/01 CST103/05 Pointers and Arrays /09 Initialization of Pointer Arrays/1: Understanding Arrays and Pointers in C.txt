Unit 1: Understanding Arrays and Pointers in C
This unit elucidates the difference between two-dimensional arrays and arrays of pointers in C. It highlights the distinction between a true two-dimensional array, like int a[10][20], and an array of pointers, such as int *b[10]. While both a[3][4] and b[3][4] reference a single int, they are fundamentally different in memory allocation and access patterns. The unit emphasizes the conventional rectangular subscript calculation for a two-dimensional array, contrasting it with the flexibility of pointer arrays that allow rows of varying lengths.
