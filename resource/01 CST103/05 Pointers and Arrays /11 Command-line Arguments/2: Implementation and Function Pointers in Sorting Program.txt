Unit 2: Implementation and Function Pointers in Sorting Program
The sorting program includes function declarations, such as strcmp for lexicographic comparison and numcmp for numeric value comparison. These functions are declared before the main function, and a pointer to the appropriate one is passed to qsort for sorting purposes. The program prioritizes main functionalities over extensive error processing for arguments.

The qsort function is designed to process any data type, not solely character strings. It expects an array of pointers, two integers specifying indices, and a function with two pointer arguments. The use of void * as a generic pointer type allows flexibility in casting pointers without losing information.
