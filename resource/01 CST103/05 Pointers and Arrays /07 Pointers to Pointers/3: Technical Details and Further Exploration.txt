Unit 3: Technical Details and Further Exploration
The final unit delves into the more technical aspects of multi-dimensional arrays and their usage in C. It clarifies the notation and access patterns for two-dimensional arrays, emphasizing how elements are stored and accessed by rows and columns. The importance of specifying dimensions when passing arrays to functions is discussed, along with the syntax and rationale behind different ways of declaring function parameters that accept multi-dimensional arrays. The unit also touches on the precedence of array brackets and pointers, a common source of confusion in C. Finally, it introduces a potential exercise to add error checking to the 'day_of_year' and 'month_day' functions, encouraging further exploration and understanding of these concepts.
