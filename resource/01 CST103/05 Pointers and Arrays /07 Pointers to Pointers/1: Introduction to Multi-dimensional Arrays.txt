Unit 1: Introduction to Multi-dimensional Arrays
Section 5.7 introduces multi-dimensional arrays in C, noting that while they are less commonly used than arrays of pointers, they have unique properties that make them suitable for certain applications. The unit starts by discussing the concept and utility of multi-dimensional arrays, particularly in scenarios requiring a rectangular data structure. The practical application highlighted is date conversion, where the need to convert between the day of the month and the day of the year presents a clear use case for two-dimensional arrays. This sets the stage for understanding how multi-dimensional arrays can simplify complex data management tasks.
