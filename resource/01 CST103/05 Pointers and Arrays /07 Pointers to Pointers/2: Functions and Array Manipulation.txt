Unit 2: Functions and Array Manipulation
This unit focuses on the implementation and functionality of two key functions: 'day_of_year' and 'month_day'. 'day_of_year' converts the month and day into the day of the year, while 'month_day' performs the reverse operation. Both functions rely on the 'daytab' array, which stores the number of days in each month for leap and non-leap years. The unit explains how the functions iterate over the 'daytab' array to calculate the desired values and how leap years are accounted for in these calculations. The design choice of using a char type for the 'daytab' array to store small non-character integers is also discussed, illustrating a nuanced use of data types in C.
