Unit 3 Exercises for Further Learning
The final unit presents several exercises designed to reinforce and expand upon the concepts discussed in the previous sections. These exercises challenge the reader to write programs that utilize command-line arguments in various ways. The tasks include writing a program to evaluate reverse Polish notation expressions, modifying existing programs to accept a list of tab stops, extending functionality to support shorthand notations for tab stops, and implementing a 'tail' program that displays the last 'n' lines of its input, where 'n' is specified as a command-line argument. These exercises encourage hands-on practice with command-line arguments and provide opportunities to explore more complex and dynamic uses of command-line parameters in C programs.
