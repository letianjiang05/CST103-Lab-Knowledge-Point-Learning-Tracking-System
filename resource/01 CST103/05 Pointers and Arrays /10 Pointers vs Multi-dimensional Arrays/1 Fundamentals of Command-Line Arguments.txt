Unit 1 Fundamentals of Command-Line Arguments
This unit introduces the basics of handling command-line arguments in C programs. It explains the role of the 'main' function's parameters 'argc' (argument count) and 'argv' (argument vector), which represent the number of command-line arguments and an array of strings representing those arguments, respectively. The unit also describes the conventional structure of 'argv', where 'argv[0]' typically contains the name of the program, and 'argv[1]' to 'argv[argc-1]' contain the actual arguments passed by the user. A simple 'echo' program is presented to illustrate how these arguments can be accessed and used within a C program.
