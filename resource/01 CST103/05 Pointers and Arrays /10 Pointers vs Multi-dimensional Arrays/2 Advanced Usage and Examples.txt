Unit 2 Advanced Usage and Examples
In this unit, the text delves into more complex scenarios and enhancements of command-line argument handling. It begins with a discussion of manipulating the 'argv' pointer for more advanced argument processing and presents a modified version of the 'echo' program that demonstrates this technique. The unit then explores a pattern-matching program inspired by the UNIX 'grep' command, highlighting how command-line arguments can be used to specify search patterns and options. It further discusses the handling of optional flags and parameters, using the '-' sign convention, and illustrates how these options can be processed and combined to affect the program's behavior, providing a more sophisticated example of command-line argument usage in C.
