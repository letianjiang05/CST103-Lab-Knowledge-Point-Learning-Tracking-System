Unit 3: Implementation Details and Enhancements
In this unit, the focus shifts to the detailed implementation of the program. It starts with the declaration and functionality of the 'lineptr' array, which holds pointers to the text lines. The 'readlines' and 'writelines' functions are introduced, detailing their roles in reading input lines into the array and printing out the sorted lines, respectively. The unit also explains the modifications made to the quicksort function to accommodate string comparison and movement through pointer manipulation. Finally, it presents a potential enhancement: rewriting the 'readlines' function to store lines in an array supplied by the main function instead of dynamically allocating storage, and prompts the reader to consider the impact on the program's performance.
