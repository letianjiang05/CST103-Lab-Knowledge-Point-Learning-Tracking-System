Unit 2: Program Structure and Sorting Logic
This unit delves into the logical structure of the sorting program, outlining its three primary steps: reading lines of input, sorting them, and then printing the sorted lines. It emphasizes the importance of dividing the program into distinct functions that correspond to these steps, with the main routine controlling the subsidiary functions. The sorting logic, especially the modifications needed to sort strings instead of integers, is discussed, including how the quicksort and Shell sort algorithms are adapted for this purpose. The concept of exchanging pointers in the array, rather than the text lines themselves, is introduced to solve the problems of complicated storage management and high overhead.
