Unit 1: Pointer Arrays and Their Application
Section 5.6 introduces the concept of pointer arrays and pointers to pointers, essential for handling variable-length data like text lines. Since pointers are variables themselves, they can be efficiently stored in arrays. This unit explains the need for a data representation that efficiently manages variable-length text lines and how pointer arrays facilitate this by allowing text lines to be accessed and manipulated efficiently. The significance of this approach is illustrated with a program designed to sort text lines into alphabetic order, similar to the UNIX sort program, highlighting the shift from sorting integers to sorting lines of text with varying lengths.
