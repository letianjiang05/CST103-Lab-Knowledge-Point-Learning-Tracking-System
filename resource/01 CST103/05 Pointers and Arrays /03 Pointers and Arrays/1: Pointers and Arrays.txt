Unit 1: Pointers and Arrays
In C, there is a strong relationship between pointers and arrays, strong enough that pointers and arrays should be discussed simultaneously. Any operation that can be achieved by array subscripting can also be done with pointers. The pointer version will in general be faster but, at least to the uninitiated, somewhat harder to understand. The declaration `int a[10];` defines an array of size 10, that is, a block of 10 consecutive objects named a[0], a[1], ...,a[9]. The notation a[i] refers to the i-th element of the array.
