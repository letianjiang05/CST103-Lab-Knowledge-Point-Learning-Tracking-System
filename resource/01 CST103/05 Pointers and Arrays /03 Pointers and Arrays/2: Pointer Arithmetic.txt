Unit 2: Pointer Arithmetic
If pa is a pointer to an integer, declared as `int *pa;`, then the assignment `pa = &a[0];` sets pa to point to element zero of a; that is, pa contains the address of a[0]. Now the assignment `x = *pa;` will copy the contents of a[0] into x. If pa points to a particular element of an array, then by definition pa+1 points to the next element, pa+i points i elements after pa, and pa-i points i elements before. Thus, if pa points to a[0], `*(pa+1)` refers to the contents of a[1], pa+i is the address of a[i], and *(pa+i) is the contents of a[i].
