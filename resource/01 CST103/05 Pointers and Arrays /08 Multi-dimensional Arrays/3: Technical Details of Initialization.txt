Unit 3: Technical Details of Initialization
The final unit delves into the technical aspects of initializing an array of pointers. It discusses the declaration of the 'name' array and how it's similar to the 'lineptr' array from previous examples. The initialization process using a list of character strings is explained, showing how each string is assigned to a corresponding position in the array and how the compiler determines the size of the array based on the number of initializers. This unit emphasizes the storage and access mechanism of strings in pointer arrays, providing insight into how arrays of pointers are managed in memory.
